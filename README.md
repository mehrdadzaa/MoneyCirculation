This Python script simulates wealth distribution among a population of agents over multiple time steps. The script includes functions to generate an initial wealth matrix based on a beta distribution, construct transaction matrices that dictate wealth exchanges, and apply modifications to these matrices over time. The model also explores the impact of introducing an "epsilon injection," which redistributes wealth from the top 5% to the bottom 10% of agents at a specific step. The results are analyzed and visualized by plotting wealth distribution and comparing scenarios with and without epsilon injection, highlighting how small interventions can affect overall wealth inequality
